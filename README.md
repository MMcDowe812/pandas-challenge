Minor Assignment Deviations
In the assignment there was a part to assign the School Summary calculation by the "School Name." After about the 3rd calculation the schools were not aligning as previous calculation which threw off tables created afterwards so I had to sort by "School ID" so it shows the index 0-14.

Also, when I formated the per_school_summary PD in the middle of the assignment, I was not able to build new DataFrames using that file cause the formatting was causing 'str vs 'int failures. I reverted table back to pre-formatted cells and then formatted at the very end to show formatting ability.

Thank you.
